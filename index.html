        The Beatles’ history
    </h2>
    <p class="black">
        Probably the most popular, influential and enduring rock group of all time, <a class="bu" href="https://www.beatlesbible.com/1957/07/06/john-lennon-meets-paul-mccartney/2/" target="_blank"> the Beatles</a> almost single-handedly reshaped rock ‘n’ roll from a genre of throwaway singles by faceless stars to an artistic medium with memorable images and idols. The Beatles placed the emphasis on a group, rather than a single individual, like Frank Sinatra or Elvis. They also set an example for all rock n roll bands to follow with their strong sense of self-determination, going against their record company and management on many issues, even refusing to tour at the height of their popularity.

That month the Beatles left for Hamburg, West Germany, with their new drummer Pete Best, to try to establish themselves in Europe. The band became a popular local act, performing at various clubs until they were expelled from the country in November because George Harrison was underage. The Beatles returned to Germany in early 1961 to record as a backup band for singer Tony Sheridan; these sessions were later released during the mid-’60s as “new” Beatles material, taking advantage of unsuspecting fans. Meanwhile Sutcliffe had left the band to

        The bizarre result, popularly referred to as The White Album but officially called The Beatles, was released in November of 1968, and featured a guest appearance by Eric Clapton on the single “While My Guitar Gently Weeps.” That same month John Lennon released a solo album recorded with his controversial new lover, Japanese artist Yoko Ono, entitled Unfinished Music No. 1 – Two Virgins. Late in 1968 an animated film inspired by the song “Yellow Submarine” was released in theaters. Despite the cheery tone of the film, created with little band involvement, the real Beatles were hardly speaking, spending more time on their personal lives and their own musical projects than on the group. In January 1969 the weary band began preparing to record a new album live in the studio, without any overdubs, tentatively entitled Get Back. For an accompanying film, the Beatles performed on the roof of their studio, their last public appearance ever. While preparing the album, the group began to fight over creative issues, and the project was shelved, while the group continued to deteriorate. On March 12,

Apple Records became a financial and legal mess. During the 1970s each of the Beatles released solo albums. Paul, performing with wife Linda in the group Wings, was the most commercially successful. John recorded on and off with Yoko Ono, and continued to attract attention for his

        Though Capitol issued singles/out-takes compilations such as Past Masters and Rarities, a lot more unreleased material remained unavailable due to ongoing legal problems, and ended up on illegal bootlegs. By the early ’90s Paul, George, Ringo and Yoko Ono settled their disagreements about contracts, permitting the re-release of long unavailable recordings.

        Though the sound quality was often abysmal, the material inferior, and the surrounding hype insulting, America’s aging Beatles’ fans ate up the three 1996 double-album releases, Beatles Anthology 1, 2, and 3, which sold over 15 million copies in less than a year. Capitol once again insists that there is no more Beatles material that will be released. Even though one of the Fab Four has broken up, they live on, almost vividly, in the hearts of the youth in the world. Nothing before or since the Beatles has affected people in such a huge way. Forty years ago, four young lads from Liverpool, England got together and grew and grew until they were bigger than anything that’s ever been seen in the music industry

        In the afternoon the Quarrymen skiffle group played at the garden fete of St Peter’s Church, Woolton, Liverpool. The performance took place on a stage in a field behind the church. In the band were Lennon (vocals, guitar), Eric Griffiths (guitar), Colin Hanton (drums), Rod Davies (banjo), Pete Shotton (washboard) and Len Garry (tea chest bass).

        The group arrived on the back of a lorry. As well as music, there were craft and cake stalls, games of hoop-la, police dog demonstrations and the traditional crowning of the Rose Queen

        I remember coming into the fete and seeing all the sideshows. And also hearing all this great music wafting in from this little Tannoy system. It was John and the band.
        I remember I was amazed and thought, ‘Oh great’, because I was obviously into the music. I remember John singing a song called ‘Come Go With Me’. He’d heard it on the radio. He didn’t really know the verses, but he knew the chorus. The rest he just made up himself.

        I just thought, ‘Well, he looks good, he’s singing well and he seems like a great lead singer to me.’ Of course, he had his glasses off, so he really looked suave. I remember John was good. He was really the only outstanding member, all the rest kind of slipped away.
